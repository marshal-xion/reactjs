React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. 
A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.
React components are JavaScript functions that return markup:


create new project with vibe -

type below in the project directory in cmd
npm create vite@latest app2 -- --template react

then type

cd app2
npm install
npm run dev

then run local host url in the browser.
