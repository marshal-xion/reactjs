React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. 
A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.
React components are JavaScript functions that return markup:

React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.

The export default keywords specify the main component in the file. 

JSX is stricter than HTML. You have to close tags like <br />. Your component also can’t return multiple JSX tags. You have to wrap them into a shared parent, 
like a <div>...</div> or an empty <>...</> wrapper:

If you have a lot of HTML to port to JSX, you can use an online converter.

In React, you specify a CSS class with className.

you write the CSS rules for it in a separate CSS file


If you use a build tool or a framework, consult its documentation to learn how to add a CSS file to your project.

JSX lets you put markup into JavaScript. Curly braces let you “escape back” into JavaScript so that you can embed 
some variable from your code and display it to the user. 



All routes are declared in <Routes> </Routes> component in the App.jsx main function

Routes are imported from react-router-dom package.

useNavigate('/filename') is also used to navigate on button clicks.

sample code

function MyButton() {

  const navigate = useNavigate(); // Hook to navigate programmatically

  const handleClick = () => {
    navigate('/about'); // Navigate to the About page
  };

  return (
    <div className="button-container">
      <h1> Hello there this is the home page </h1>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
    </div>

      
  );

}
